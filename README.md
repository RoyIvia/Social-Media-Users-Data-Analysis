# Social-Media-Users-Data-Analysis
This repository contains the analysis of the Social Media Users dataset using SQL and MySQL Workbench.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the Social Media Users dataset, which contains information about user demographics and their social media usage patterns.

### Difficulties Faced

One of the difficulties faced during the import process was handling inconsistent data formats, especially dates and numerical values. Ensuring all data was correctly formatted and consistent was crucial for accurate analysis.

### Interesting Insight

One interesting thing noticed about the dataset is the significant variance in social media usage across different age groups and regions. Younger age groups (18-24) tend to spend significantly more time on social media compared to older age groups (55+). Additionally, there are noticeable differences in platform preferences across different regions.
